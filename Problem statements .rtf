 Serial Data Pattern Detector (1101 Detection with Overlapping)

 Problem Statement:
       Design an FSM that detects the binary sequence "1101" from a serial input stream. The detection should support overlapping sequences (e.g., input: 11101101 should detect twice).

 Inputs:
 clk, reset
 data_in (1-bit serial input)

 Outputs:
 detected â†’   High when the pattern 1101 is found

 States:
 S0: No match
 S1: 1 matched (1)
 S2: 2 matched (11)
 S3: 3 matched (110)
 S4: Pattern detected
